\section{Chapter1 Beginning}
Latex treats blank and table the same space, many sequential blank is also treated as a space.
A new blank line indicates a new paragraph, and multiple new blank line  is also the same as one.


Special character: use $\backslash$ to generate to,  $\backslash\backslash$ is just a new line command. And many
special characters are represented by $\backslash$ + character , for example, \# is represented
by $\backslash$ with \#  

Add some blank after the command, like \TeX{} otherwise it doesn't know how to end, or just \TeX leave blank here

This is a very long commment, however it needs to add packages verbatim
\end{comment}

latex foo.tex % from .tex to .dvi
xdvi foo.dvi % preview dvi
dvips -Pcmz foo.dvi -o foo.ps % convert to .ps


% \documentclass[11pt, twoside, a4paper]{article}
% article, report, book, slides
% pagestyle{style} plain, headings, empty .... for page foot or head
% \include to add for large documents


\section{Chapter2 Structure}

% \\*, add a new line(not new paragraph) but forbid new page
% \newpage, add a new page
% \mbox to add some words in the same line
% \fbox is the same as mbox but gives a rectangle on the words.

whatever the before is how long, \mbox{I am in the same line}


\fbox{I am in rectangle}


Don't think that two \textsl{yinhao} is the right one, use two seperated single-yinhao to add it
for example:

''Please press the 'X' key.''
